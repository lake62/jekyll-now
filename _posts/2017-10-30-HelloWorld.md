title: My first post! Yay!
---

Wanted to create a blog to share information and be part of a network. The internet is a great way to break free from the solitude of the isolated islands we live on.

The goals are networking (getting to know people with the same interests), colloberating (creating and improving to further health and happiness), to track my progress and give ideas and guide my readers.

I'm a thinker. I can think about small things for hours. My ideas are ideas most people cannot imagine that can be made possible. I'm pragmatic. I'm not a concise programmer. I'm creative.
